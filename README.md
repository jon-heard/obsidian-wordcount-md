# Word Count - markdown oriented

Counts the NON-MARKDOWN words of selected text in the editor.

This word count plugin is different in that it considers a word as any non-spaced character string with AT LEAST ONE alpha-numeric character.  This is important, because markdown can include A LOT of non-word text, which traditional word counters will display with mis-leadingly large word counts.
