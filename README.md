# Word Count - markdown oriented

Counts the NON-MARKDOWN words of selected text in the editor.

This word count plugin is different in that it considers a word as any non-spaced character string with AT LEAST ONE alpha-numeric character.  This is important, because markdown can include A LOT of non-word text, which traditional word counters will display with mis-leadingly large word counts.

This is based on lukeleppan's [Better Word Count](https://github.com/lukeleppan/better-word-count) plugin, though highly modified.  I wrote it for personal use, so I'm not going to submit it to the community, but feel free to use the [Beta Reviewers Auto-update Tester](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) plugin to bring it into your vault.
